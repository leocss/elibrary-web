            Lets discuss a little...
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: RobotoRegular; font-size: 15px;">
            I setup this system basically to act as a bootstrap that we all will/may use in developing
            each of our specific modules... I choose to use a micro-framework (Silex) since some of
            us are not totally comfortable in using a full blown featured framework like Symfony/Zend/Laravel.
        </p>

        <p style="font-family: RobotoRegular; font-size: 15px;">
            The pages here contains a very minimal implementation of each module and does not include all functionality...
            This is meant to act as an example showing you how the e-library API is consumed...
            I will try to add comments to every part of the source code so that it explains itself...
        </p>
